# EZCam
_to capture life's memories away from the digital world_

## entry #0 - 6/13

welcome back! it's time for my FOURTH highway project! i can't believe i'm starting another one even though none of my first three have been built yet -- shame on long wait times for project approval and shipping. :(

this time, i'll be building something specifically lacking any electronics. this is for aesthetic choice (to capture life's memories free of the grasp of the 21st century / modern digital world) and also totally not because i'm trash at electronics design.

introducing EZCam! it's basically just a fully mechanical instax. it uses instax film, but everything has been designed to work without any motors, circuit boards, etc. it's 3D printable and works with a 3D printer, springs, and a lens.

the goal is for the mechanical design to be fleshed out so that the shutter will be activated by a button press and the film will be rolled out using a set of spring-loaded rollers that are hand-cranked.

it's 5:16 am while i'm writing this (i've spent all night fixing my third highway project, easy75, and talking about flights to undercity with my friends who may also go) -- i have to sleep now but i'll get back to this tomorrow!
